# Ogar-GogyBot
Plugin provides bots for [Ogar](https://github.com/OgarProject/Ogar), the open-source Agar.io server implementation.

## References
The bot is using steering behavior for calculating his direction. You can learn more about steering behavior from [this paper]
(http://www.red3d.com/cwr/papers/1999/gdc99steer.pdf).

More information about project and purpose of this project is available on my [website](http://vodila.webdraft.info/diplomovka/) (only Slovak version yet).

## Instalation
1. Insert `gogybot` folder to `src/plugins/` folder.
2. Run your server
3. You can now spawn new bots simply by execute `addgogybot n` command, where `n` is number of bots to spawn.
